# TIPS

* Carefully read each instruction and execute it step by step. Skipping steps can lead to errors that are hard to debug later.
* If you’re unsure about a command or process, seek clarification immediately—don’t guess!
* Prioritize studying for the quiz—it plays a crucial role in your understanding and performance.
* Manage your time wisely and aim to complete OS assignments early to handle any unforeseen issues.
* Remember, pop quizzes are a significant part of your learning, so take them seriously!
* Consistently complete all assignments and quizzes; failing to do so could lead to additional tasks in the ATTN Forum. Stay disciplined!
